/**
 * Plugin Threaded interface.<br>
 * <br>
 * By default a plugin is launched on the AWT Event Dispatch Thread so GUI creation
 * can be done directly without <code>invokeLater</code> calls.<br>
 * A common problem is that long process will actually lock the EDT and make GUI not responding.<br>
 * <br>
 * A plugin implementing this interface will have both its <code>run()</code> methods called
 * in a separate thread but developer has to use <code>invokeLater</code> method
 * for GUI creation / modification. Also there is no more guarantee that plugin constructor is called
 * in the EDT (which is the case for default plugin).
